  <h1>Plan</h1>
  <h2>Legend</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 large square = 1 metre, 1 small square = 25 cm.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The land</h2>
  <svg id="canvas-land" viewBox="0 0 40 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
  <ul>
    <li>Add: poultry, ponds (in-greenhouse mostly), alpacas/sheep/goats.</li>
    Now: Freya/chicken, goats vs trees, how do you organise space?
    Add trees to visualise how many of what can I have, bamboo, strawberries etc.
  </ul>

  <h2>Underground pond</h2>
  <svg id="canvas-pond" viewBox="0 0 11 7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Dome floor:</b> concrete floor with glass blocks. Allow entry. Below is the deepest point with many hideouts.</li>
    <li><b>Ring floor:</b> expanded metal, allow humidity for the plants. Several entry points.</li>
    E/W humans/turtles basking.
  </ul>

  <h3>Species</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tilapia:</b> 25–30 °C.</li>
    <li><b>Catfish:</b> Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) 24–30 °C or African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) 26–32 °C. African catfish is hardier and more tolerant of low oxygen and crowding.</li>
    <li><b>Redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus):</b> 26–30 °C.</li>
    <li><b>Red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans):</b> 24–28 °C.</li>
    <li><b>Freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergi):</b> 26–31 °C.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    With: 70k litre tank, natural aeration from plants, feeding worms/BSFL and partial daily exchange, you can safely aim for: 80–120 kg/year yield, possibly more.

  <h2>Ground floor</h2>
  <svg id="canvas-ground" viewBox="0 0 11 9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
  <ul>
    STOVE not floating, but rather the whole floor would be steel (can be covered by wood) and lowered compared to the ring around.
    <li><b>Storage:</b> below the workshops.</li>
    <li><b>Plants:</b> coffee, tea, cacao; turmeric, ginger, cardamom. All require high humidity, perhaps re-evalute the expanded metal thingy from the fish pond. Black pepper, vanilla (requires hand pollination). Tulsi.</li>
    <li><b>Height:</b> 3m to allow enough space for cacao (don't forget to count the maceta...or we could perhaps have parts that go below the floor level? Since there will be a fair air gap for people, maybe 50cm). Would be only required for certain plants like cacao.</li>
    <li><b>Dome:</b> vents just off the ground to suck air out of the storage and circulate it properly.</li>
    <li><b>Dome:</b> roof window to allow releasing the heat when one is inside and closing it for when we need to charge the structure with heat.</li>
    <li><b>Dome:</b> translucent glass (bottles or glass blocks) in the ceiling.</li>
    <li><b>Storage:</b> needs to be large to store all we need post-collapse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Upper levels</h2>
  <svg id="canvas-upper" viewBox="0 0 11 9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
  <ul>
    PERHAPS expanded metal with glass below, so the humid zone is sealed.
    <li><b>Bedroom:</b> goes right above the dome, possibly suspended and covered by a woolen blanket.</li>
    PERHAPS DOME not dome after all, but rather with a wooden ceiling? but then it could be buffering somewhat poorly? Think it through well. Also, how about the glass blocks?
